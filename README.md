## üöÄ Features

* **üéÆ Dual Game Modes**: Choose to play against another person on the same device or against a sophisticated bot.
* **ü§ñ Multiple Bot Difficulties**: The AI opponent comes with three distinct settings:
    * **Easy**: The bot makes random, unpredictable moves.
    * **Medium**: The bot plays defensively, blocking player wins while looking for its own opportunities.
    * **Impossible**: The bot uses the minimax algorithm to play a perfect game, making it impossible to defeat (you can only win or draw).
* **üì± Responsive Design**: The game is fully optimized for a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **üé® Clear & Modern UI**: The interface clearly indicates the current player's turn, the game's outcome (win/draw), and highlights the winning combination of cells.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Interactive Setup**: A simple and user-friendly menu to select the game mode and difficulty before each match.

## üìÇ File Structure

The project is organized into three separate files for better readability and maintainability:

* `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the game board, setup screen, and control buttons.
* `style.css`: Provides the custom styles for game elements, player markers (`X` and `O`), and winning animations. It works in conjunction with Tailwind CSS.
* `script.js`: Houses all the game logic, including handling player moves, checking for wins/draws, and the AI algorithms for the bot opponent.

## Î£∞ How to Play

1.  **Choose Your Opponent**: On the main screen, select whether you want to play against a "Human" or a "Bot".
2.  **Select Difficulty** (if playing vs. Bot): If you chose "Vs. Bot", three difficulty options will appear. Click on "Easy", "Medium", or "Impossible".
3.  **Start Playing**: The game board will appear. Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 (or the Bot) is 'O'. Player 'X' always goes first.
4.  **Take Turns**: Click on any empty square on the grid to place your marker.
5.  **Win the Game**: The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the round.
6.  **New Game**: After a game ends, click the "New Game" button to return to the main menu and start a new match.
